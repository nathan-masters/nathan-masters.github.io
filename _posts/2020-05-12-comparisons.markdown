# Confinement is in progress... and so is this website.

Just a quick post to present the direct comparison of cumulative deaths for a number of
countries. 

It turns out Bokeh's use of a dedicated Source Data Structure makes quick changes a little
difficult.

These graphs use the easily available data from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide){:target="_blank"}.

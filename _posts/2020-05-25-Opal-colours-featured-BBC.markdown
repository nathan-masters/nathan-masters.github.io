# Confinement is in progress... and so is this website.

Colours of everyday items typically come from the pigments within them. Think of the clothes
you own, or the items around your house. The vast majority of these are coloured by the
pigments inherent to the materials or the dyes which are used during manufacture. The 
paint on the walls has been carefully mixed with certain ratios of pigments to ensure that
you get the perfect complement for your home. But take a moment to look out of the window
and (hopefully) you'll see the perfect blue of a sunny sky. Is this colour produced in the
same way as the colours you see on your clothes? It doesn't seem like it. For instance, the
colour of the sky seems to change even without clouds. The closer you look towards the sun,
the paler the blue colour is. In the evening, a beautiful sunset can create warmer colours.
And yet, what's changing? The sun itself isn't changing, it's way out in space continuing
to produced light in much the same way it has for billions of years. The atmosphere as such
isn't changing much either. It's still composed of a similar ratio of molecules as it was
when the sun rose. There certainly isn't a sudden change in the concentration of pigments
in the sky in the last hour or two before the night. In the case of the sky, and in fact
many examples including the distinctive *Morpho* butterfly, the colour comes from elsewhere. 
Not from pigment, but from the underlying structure. This is structural colour.

The reason for this post, came about because the BBC recently posted an article discussing
["What you didn't know about
colour"](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200512-what-you-didnt-
know-about-colour){:target="_blank"}. Not only do they talk about structural colour, but
also the use of opals. For me, this is pretty special, not only was my entire PhD thesis
about the study of structural colour in plants, but two of my study species contained
opal-like structures. These had never been described in plants before.

<blockquote>
<p>"The non-pigmented opals assume a particular colour when light hits them â€“ a
phenomenon called structural colour. Her [Lindsay Hanson's] research suggests that the
opals and graphene can be fused to make a power grid that is concealed within
clothing. Its wearer can then change its colours and patterns in infinite ways, via an
app on their smartphone."</p>

The colour in opal structures arise because there is a regularity in the structure. Inside
opal gems, spheres of silicon dioxide are arranged together tightly. Packed together like
a heap of oranges might be at the supermarket. Because the spheres are all the same size,
there exists a regular distance between each sphere, and when this corresponds to a 
characteristic length, we begin to see colour emerging. In essence, what this means is that
certain wavelengths of light are being reflected more so than others by the structure. 
These wavelengths give the structure colour.

In my work investigating this, we discovered that similar structures exist in a particular
seaweed called *Cystoseira tamariscifolia*, or Bushy Rainbow Wrack. This seaweed can be
easily found in the rockpools of Cornwall where they have an exceptional and quite 
distinctive blue colour. 

The wonderful colour of this algae is only dependent on the structure alone, and so when 
Lindsay Hanson, whose research was highlighted by the BBC, discusses implementing these 
structures with electronics, we can see how colour may be controlled. Very slight changes
in osmotic pressure for example could alter the arrangement of these opal spheres, and 
entirely change colour of light reflected. In fact, this was also observed in our studies
of the Bushy Rainbow Wrack seaweed. The blue colour appeared or disappeared depending on 
how much light was experienced by the seaweed. It's anticipated that this is a mechanism for
managing photosynthesis, but perhaps similar artificial techniques could indeed be used in the
fashion industry!

It's exciting to see how the research we were able to conduct can have far-reaching and
often unexpected impacts. It demonstrates that our research has value, and justifies to me
the many hours of hard work we all put in to this project. If you'd like to read more you

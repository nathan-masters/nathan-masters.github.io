# Confinement is in progress... and so is this website.

I've recently been trying to understand Python a bit better with a few exercises. Previously
I've typically worked in R for data analysis and visualisation, but with the added time on my hands
I've had the opportunity to try and get to know another system.

It's nice to have the opportunity to suddenly be given a huge amount of publicly available data,
and I'm sure like many people who are able to make their own plots and analyse the data, the 
temptation was there to make some comparisons. I was mainly inspired by the plots of the 
[Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a26fbf7e-48f8-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441){:target="_blank"} created by 
[@jburnmurdoch](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch){:target="_blank"}. 

Anyway, here are some initial attempts to put together some plots using the easily available data
from the [European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide){:target="_blank"}.

I'll have a look at how else I can begin to plot this data interactively.

# **Hi!**

![hand-in-pic](../assets/img/hand-in-pic.jpeg# right prop35 "Me!"){:width="250px"}



A doctoral graduate in biology, I am an enthusiastic and friendly individual. With a 
technical and critical approach to problem solving, I relish the chance to work as part 
of team on a wide variety of projects. Outside of the workplace, I love being in the 
mountains and sharing these experiences with others.

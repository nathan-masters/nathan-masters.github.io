# About Me

![personal-banner](../assets/img/nathan-portrait-2-crop.jpg# right prop45 "Me!"){:width="250px"}

Having recently completed my PhD at the University of Bristol I've spent the last four years 
studying how plants and algae can exhibit structural colour. This is when the colour which is reflected 
originates from the nanoscale structures, rather than pigment. Similar to rainbow colours 
on the back of a CD. Plants and algae have developed these techniques for reasons ranging 
from increased photosynthesis, protection from the sun, and to attract pollinators. To answer 
our questions we explored the internal cellular structures using cryogenic electron microscopy 
techniques alongside optical simulation models.

Away from academia, there's nowhere I'd rather be than in the mountains. My personal passion
has also been my profession recently. As a qualified Mountain Leader and Rock Climbing 
Instructor, I enjoy taking other people into these fantastic environments. In these roles, 
it is the opportunity to pass on my knowledge and my enthusiasm for the outdoors which 
brings the greatest reward.

# **Hi!**

![hand-in-pic](../assets/img/nathan-troll-wall.jpg# right prop45 "Me!"){:width="250px"}



Freelance outdoor instructor to hire! I am a young, friendly, reliable, and competent leader, with 
over 4 years of experience taking groups into the mountains and to the crag. In a year since
completing my Mountain Leader and Rock Climbing Instructor awards, I've been providing
DofE support, on a month-long international expedition, volunteering with the BMC, and 
hooking electric scooters out of rivers...

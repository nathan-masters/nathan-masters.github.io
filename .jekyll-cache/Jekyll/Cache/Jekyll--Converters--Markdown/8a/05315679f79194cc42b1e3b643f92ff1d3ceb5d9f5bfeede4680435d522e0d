<p>Inevitably, as confinement dragged on over a couple of months here in Switzerland, and 
likewise it seems all over the Europe, the weather was positively glorious! The skies were
big with dawn to dusk blue skies, while we were all cooped up in our homes with nowhere to go.
The view of our neighbours‚Äô extensive balconies in the sun taunted us each day‚Ä¶</p>

<p>But just as May was getting under way, and the summer felt like it was truly beginning to arrive
there was a spot of cold weather. Rain came, and temperatures fell, and suddenly it was 
the beginning of spring again. ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs to be expected, it‚Äôs the Saints des Glace‚Äù, my 
partner mentioned off hand as if it was something I really should have known about. The
idea that a brief drop in cold weather occurred annually with such regularity there were a 
group of saints collectively known as the Ice Saints was pretty exciting. Perhaps, rather
na√Øvely I laughed off the suggestion that this was ‚Äúa real thing‚Äù‚Ä¶ Surely not‚Ä¶</p>

<p>So much to her annoyance, I was soon explaining how so many of these phenomena are purely
coincidence, and subject to perception bias, etc., etc‚Ä¶ Unsurprisingly, this didn‚Äôt ease 
any tensions. We changed the subject. If confinement in a studio flat has taught us anything,
it‚Äôs how to let sleeping dogs lie.</p>

<p>But while those dogs slept quietly, plans were afoot. I was soon back at my laptop
utilising some of my new found python knowledge, to see if I could provide at least a crumb
of empirical evidence, against her, and seemingly centuries of tradition, that claimed a
wonderful meteorological phenomenon was occurring.</p>

<p>Foremost, it seems obtaining data for extensive previous meteorological measurements can be 
somewhat difficult - at least without paying the Swiss weather organisation, or any number
of other data resellers online. But, eventually, and with my eyes subconsciously glancing
over many obtrusive advertisements I was able to very slowly collect average daily temperatures
in May for the Geneva Airport. And, I was initially a little taken back‚Ä¶</p>

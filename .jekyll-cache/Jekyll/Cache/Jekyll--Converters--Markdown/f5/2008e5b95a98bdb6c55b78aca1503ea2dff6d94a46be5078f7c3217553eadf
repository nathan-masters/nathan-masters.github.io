<p>Iâ€™ve recently been trying to understand Python a bit better with a few exercises. Previously
Iâ€™ve typically worked in R for data analysis and visualisation, but with the added time on my hands
Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to try and get to know another system.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s nice to have the opportunity to suddenly be given a huge amount of publicly available data,
and Iâ€™m sure like many people who are able to make their own plots and analyse the data, the 
temptation was there to make some comparisons. I was mainly inspired by the plots of the

<a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch" target="_blank">@jburnmurdoch</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, here are some initial attempts to put together some plots using the easily available data
from the <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide" target="_blank">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control</a>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll have a look at how else I can begin to plot this data interactively.</p>

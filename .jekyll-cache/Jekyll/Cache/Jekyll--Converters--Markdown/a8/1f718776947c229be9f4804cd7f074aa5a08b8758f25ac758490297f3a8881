<p>Colours of everyday items typically come from the pigments within them. Think of the clothes
you own, or the items around your house. The vast majority of these are coloured by the
pigments inherent to the materials or the dyes which are used during manufacture. The 
paint on the walls has been carefully mixed with certain ratios of pigments to ensure that
you get the perfect complement for your home. But take a moment to look out of the window
and (hopefully) you‚Äôll see the perfect blue of a sunny sky. Is this colour produced in the
same way as the colours you see on your clothes? It doesn‚Äôt seem like it. For instance, the
colour of the sky seems to change even without clouds. The closer you look towards the sun,
the paler the blue colour is. In the evening, a beautiful sunset can create warmer colours.
And yet, what‚Äôs changing? The sun itself isn‚Äôt changing, it‚Äôs way out in space continuing
to produced light in much the same way it has for billions of years. The atmosphere as such
isn‚Äôt changing much either. It‚Äôs still composed of a similar ratio of molecules as it was
when the sun rose. There certainly isn‚Äôt a sudden change in the concentration of pigments
in the sky in the last hour or two before the night. In the case of the sky, and in fact
many examples, the colour comes from elsewhere. Not from pigment, but from the underlying
structure. This is structural colour.</p>

<p>The reason for this post, came about because the BBC recently posted an article discussing
<a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200512-what-you-didnt-
know-about-colour" target="_blank">‚ÄúWhat you didn‚Äôt know about
colour‚Äù</a>. Not only do they talk about structural colour, but
also the use of opals. For me, this is pretty special, not only was my entire PhD thesis
about the study of structural colour in plants, but two of my study species contained
opal-like structures. These had never been described in plants before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The non-pigmented opals assume a particular colour when light hits them ‚Äì a
phenomenon called structural colour. Her [Lindsay Hanson's] research suggests that the
opals and graphene can be fused to make a power grid that is concealed within
clothing. Its wearer can then change its colours and patterns in infinite ways, via an
app on their smartphone."</p>

<p>The colour in opal structures arise because there is a regularity in the structure. Inside
opal gems, spheres of silicon dioxide are arranged together tightly. Packed together like
a heap of oranges might be at the supermarket. Because the spheres are all the same size,
there exists a regular distance between each sphere, and when this corresponds to a 
characteristic length, we begin to see colour emerging. In essence, what this means is that
certain wavelengths of light are being reflected more so than others by the structure. 
These wavelengths give the structure colour.</p>

<p>In my work investigating this, we discovered that similar structures exist in a particular
seaweed called <em>Cystoseira tamariscifolia</em>, or Bushy Rainbow Wrack. This seaweed can be
easily found in the rockpools of Cornwall where they have an exceptional and quite 
distinctive blue colour.</p>

<p>The wonderful colour of this algae is only dependent on the s</p>
